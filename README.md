# arma-2-Campaign_Creator

ArmA 2 tool to create base campaign files, not playbale campaign but working structure where its really easy to fill in playable missions.

Creates:
* mission editor loadable init.sqf, description.ext and mission.sqm files
* mission editor loadable cutscenes
* overview.html + placeholder paa file

Supports campaign creation up to 999 missions, should be enough for everyone, huh? :)
